You chose 'c', but the correct answer is 'd'. Let's understand why!

The question likely dealt with a part of a plant (e.g., which part helps the plant absorb water).  Option 'd' (the root) is the correct answer because roots are specifically designed to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.  The stem supports the plant, the leaves make food through photosynthesis, and the flower is involved in reproduction.  The roots are the plant's water and nutrient intake system.


**Memory Trick:** Think of a thirsty plant. What part goes into the ground to drink?  The roots!

Don't worry about getting it wrong! Keep practicing, and you'll master this topic in no time.  Perhaps try reviewing the parts of a plant again, using diagrams or flashcards. You could also try a slightly easier question to build your confidence before tackling similar questions again.  Keep up the great effort!
